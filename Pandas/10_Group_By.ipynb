    "Sometimes we want to select data based on groups and understand aggregated data on a group level. We have seen that even though Pandas allows us to iterate over every row in a dataframe, it is generally very slow to do so. Fortunately Pandas has a groupby() function to speed up such task. The idea behind the groupby() function is that it takes some dataframe, splits it into chunks based on some key values, applies computation on those chunks, then combines the results back together into another dataframe. In pandas this is referred to as the split-apply-combine pattern."
